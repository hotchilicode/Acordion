        <h2 class="accordion-title">Questions About Blue Whales</h2>
    
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">What is the size of a blue whale, and how does it compare to other animals?</div>
            <div class="answer">Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) are not only the largest animals alive today but also
                the largest animals to have ever existed on Earth. Adult blue whales can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30
                meters) or more, and they can weigh as much as 200 tons (approximately 181 metric tonnes). To visualize
                their size, consider this comparison: a blue whale's heart alone can weigh as much as a small car, and its
                tongue can weigh as much as an elephant.
    
                In comparison to other large animals, blue whales dwarf even the largest dinosaurs ever recorded. For
                instance, the largest known dinosaur, Argentinosaurus, might have reached lengths of around 100 feet, but
                estimates on its weight are often around 70 tons, significantly lighter than a blue whale. When you consider
                the volume of a blue whale, they can displace enough water to fill several swimming pools. Their immense
                size not only astonishes researchers and the general public alike but also poses unique challenges for their
                ecology, physiology, and conservation. </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">What do blue whales eat, and how do they hunt for food?</div>
            <div class="answer">Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called
                krill. An adult blue whale can consume an astonishing 4 tons (approximately 3,600 kilograms) of krill every
                day during feeding season, which typically occurs in colder waters where krill are abundant. To hunt for
                krill, blue whales utilize a unique feeding technique known as lunge feeding.
    
                During this process, a blue whale opens its enormous mouth and engulfs a large amount of water filled with
                krill. It then closes its mouth and forces the water out through its baleen platesâ€”a series of overlapping,
                comb-like structures that filter the krill from the water. This method is highly effective, allowing blue
                whales to take in vast quantities of food in just one gulp.
    
                Interestingly, blue whales have developed specific migratory patterns that follow seasonal changes in water
                temperature and krill availability, traveling thousands of miles from feeding grounds in polar regions to
                warmer breeding areas. By understanding their feeding habits and migratory behaviors, scientists continue to
                uncover the complexities of their ecology and the environmental pressures they face, especially in light of
                climate change. </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question">What are the conservation statuses and threats facing blue whales?</div>
            <div class="answer">Blue whales are currently classified as endangered by the International Union for
                Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to historic whaling practices. In the early 20th century,
                commercial whaling decimated blue whale populations, leading to a dramatic decline. At the height of
                whaling, it is estimated that over 300,000 blue whales were killed, resulting in a population drop of more
                than 90%.
    
                Although international bans on commercial whaling have helped populations begin to recover slowly, blue
                whales still face a number of threats. One significant threat is ship strikes, as ships traveling in areas
                where blue whales feed or migrate can collide with these large animals. Entanglement in fishing gear is
                another serious risk that can lead to injury or death. Additionally, climate change poses a profound threat
                to blue whales by altering their feeding grounds and the distribution of krill, which may impact their
                foraging success.
    
                Conservation efforts focus on protecting blue whale habitats, managing vessel traffic in critical areas, and
                conducting ongoing research to monitor their populations. Organizations and governments are increasingly
                becoming aware of the need for integrated marine management strategies that consider the complex
                interactions between blue whales, their prey, and the marine ecosystem as a whole. Through these efforts,
                there is hope for these magnificent giants to continue their slow recovery in our oceans.
    
                Overall, blue whales symbolize the awe-inspiring nature of marine biodiversity, but they also highlight the
                critical challenges that many species face in a rapidly changing world. </div>
